On first day session I had learnt about basic information about git like what is git benifits of git how it is been used.Later I created github account and started editing in git bash. First i created a new branch called test_data and added a text document called mytest then checked the status. After that I commited that branch through which it goes to staging directory  because we cant push our code directly to rpository. Then I used git push to push that branch from staging directory to folder.Git checkout is used to create new branch.
